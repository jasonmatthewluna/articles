<p class = "artsub">Free-to-Play gaming's latest sweetheart, Genshin Impact, has found massive success, earning $250 million USD within a month and a half but the game has failed to build a meaningful cooperative community.</p>
<p>Genshin Impact released September 28, 2020 to much fanfare, immediately drawing comparisons to Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with both its artstyle and gameplay. Both feature a semi-open world with a paint-brush, anime-influenced artstyle.</p>
<p>However, Genshin Impact differs in one main way: Gacha. Players use in-game currency, which can also be purchased with real cash, for a chance to collect new playable characters. Of course, with its artstyle, these characters are usually attractive waifus and husbandos.</p>
<p>Evidently, this revenue stream has been successful: Genshin Impact has surpassed the revenue of other top grossing mobile games worldwide, such as PUBG and Pokemon GO, for the past month. In addition to its mobile revenue, Genshin Impact is also popular on other platforms, PC and PS4 included.</p>
<p>But with the middling amount of released content and how many players are rapidly approaching Genshin Impact's current endgame, players are curious how long Mihoyo can keep its stride.</p>
<p>For one, the game has yet to compete with any triple A titles or major new releases. While many predicted their activity would drop off once the hotly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 released, Cyperpunk 2077's release was delayed another month, leaving Genshin Impact safe in its current throne.</p>
<p>In terms of actual gameplay, a major theme of user complaints, outside of stamina, a gacha mainstay, is a lack of proper co-op progression. Though Genshin Impact boasts multi-platform co-op, in reality, the game does not permit additional players to complete quests, unlock waypoints, or open chests. In truth, co-op is a vehicle for players to complete an already quick daily farming cycle even faster.</p>
<p>Developers did attempt to solve this issue by releasing the Elemental Crucible, the game's first co-op event where users fought waves of enemies and collected elemental cubes they needed to return to the middle of the map. Unfortunately, this gameplay was instanced and faced connection issues. Some players would face a bug that would leave them unable to collect cubes, kneecapping the event and the ability for cooperation.</p>
<p>The rewards were lackluster too: Players could already receive similar rewards (EXP books, etc.) at similar cost in their individual gameplay.</p>
<p>A new event, with compelling, unique rewards—or at the very least, rewards better than could be received in single player content—might motivate players to take more care in their multiplayer interactions rather than view the event as a chore gating them from future progression.</p>
<p>Even outside of the game, Mihoyo's support for the community is lackluster.</p>
<p>With the upcoming 1.1 release, which is Mihoyo's first major content update, Chinese users received more rewards than users from the American server. Worse, PS4 users were ineligible for any rewards at all.</p>
<p>Considering a common user complaint across all user communities is how startlingly scarce in-game currency becomes at the end of version 1's story, it's not in Mihoyo's benefit to place these communities against one another.</p>
<p>North American servers also complained that their patch preview livestream was poorly scripted and not prepared.</p>
<p>Mihoyo has also struggled with community management. Though there is a Discord server for feedback, conversation, and exclusive events, the server has reached max capacity and new users can no longer join.</p>
<p>As for content creators and forum interactions, the highest number of posts involve drumming up drama between whales and F2P users, complaints about the game, and guides about best-in-slot equipment, farming routes, and already easily accessible information like ascension requirements.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how long Mihoyo can continue on their success with a six-week release cycle.</p>
<p>However, even with all the complaints, money is what speaks loudest and the fact that Genshin Impact sits at #1 is the biggest indicator that gamers are not putting their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p>The average grumbler lamenting how they've already completed all available content likely isn't taking into account gaming's core drivers: monthly active users (MAU), lifetime value (LTV), and cost per install (CPI).</p>
<p>As long as Mihoyo can rapidly aquire new users who haven't even come across the game's first quest at low cost, keep its players on the hook until the next patch with decent retention, and maintain their cash flow from each of these groups, the company will do just fine even without renewed efforts to further community interaction.</p>
<p>Lucky for Mihoyo, Genshin Impact isn't the type of game that requires a large community, and the anime-influenced style and gacha genre will always be in fashion. The game might need to update its branding and give up its co-op trappings for success, but its clear its singleplayer gameplay loop is a winning formula.</p>
