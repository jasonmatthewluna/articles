<h1 class = "arthead">Animal Crossing: New Horizons' Conversations are an Existential Nightmare</h1>
<p class = "artsub">As a Villager since the series' GameCube days, I've been a part of so many villages, cities, islands... and spoken with so many villagers. It might be nostalgia, but I miss the sass and severity of older villagers instead of the existential nightmares of New Horizons.
</p>
<p>I remember rushing home from school, inputting the 30,000 bell cheats for my mom so I could play on a weekday, and helping her get the golden statue before my older brother did for more brownie points.</p>
<p>I remember how furious my brother was when he won the Fishing Tournament... and was subsequently robbed of his first place trophy by a bird or duck villager. (I swear it was Piper).</p>
<p>And I remember how much I loved all of my original villagers.</p>
<p>Even though I did end up allowing him to leave because of how little affection I had for the Jock personality type in New Horizons, I was so excited to have Boots as one of my first fellow islanders.</p>
<p>I was absolutely ecstatic when I got Goldie, whom, in the GameCube version, I would spam talk to until she got angry.</p>
<p>But in Animal Crossing's latest installment, even a couple of interactions will lead villagers to question you: "Hey, didn't I just talk to you...?"</p>
<p>And it's without the same personality, the same sass GameCube characters would drop on you.</p>
<p>Even worse is that the conversations leading up to that repetitive message telling you to wait before you can get a new interaction is having your jock villager tell you about their abs or work out routine... for the seventh time.</p>
<p>These conversations aren't terrible, but I do miss when villagers could get legitimately angry at you and had unique dialogue.</p>
<p>In New Horizons, raising your friendship level solves this to some extent, but there simply isn't enough variation or unique dialogue for specific villagers.</p>
<p>And, some villagers will suddenly have an existential crisis: "They say the island is just a game... just to amuse somebody else."</p>
<p>It's a fun little piece of trivia the first timethey comment on the insanity behind Tom Nook's financial plan, but sometimes, you just want a peaceful, escapist grind. Especially in today's time.</p>
<p>New Horizons' beauty promises that, but its conversations will break that immersion and remind you that these are characters, not neighbors.</p>
