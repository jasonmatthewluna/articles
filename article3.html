    <p class ="artsub">George's simple song captures listeners with its unique blend of R&B and ballad.</p>
    <p>Boat begins with a gentle fade-in of the piano and a steady percussion beat alongside sounds of wind swirling about.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, there's a burst of energy, and George croons his soulful song, minimal in both its lyrics and instrumental, about love or sailing away or the ocean... I think.</p>
    <p>I don't purport to understand Korean, nor will I look up and trust an online English translation for this piece. I also can't profess to be any kind of musical expert; in fact, I took The Music Lab's tone deafness quiz and scored in the 22nd percentile... on my third try.</p>
    <p>However, it is obvious to me that the song only seems to have two verses and a repeated chorus.</p>
    <p>I will say that I know that this song is a beautiful, simple song filled with ideas about space and when the piano twinkles brightly in the background, it feels like I'm sailing through an ocean of stars.</p>
    <p>The song plays with the concept of distance, cutting out 	percussion or the melody as necessary before coming to a slow build back up and bursting with energy again at the chorus.</p>
    <p>Strange synths sound like aliens murmuring around me. Yet, they're also comforting me, on the journey alongside me.</p>
    <p>At the end, we return to just the piano playing us out. No more turbulent winds.</p>
    <p>Considering how minimal the rest of the track is and what little of the song is in English, maybe it's best to take the song's meaning at face value as well.</p>
    <p>George is on a boat, sailing farther and farther way. It's nothing more, nothing less.</p>
    <p>It must be a beautiful ride.</p>
