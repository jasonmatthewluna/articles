<p class ="artsub">Lori Gottlieb explores the patient-therapist relationship with podcast host Dax Shepard and explains why everyone, especially therapists, needs therapy.</p>
<p>I recently got hooked on Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard, a podcast that distills its guest’s human experience into a neat 2 hour package.</p>
<p>It was an instant addiction—I sped through four episodes in the two days and have since passed the bug on to my roommate.</p>
<p>Armchair Expert's explosive growth has bought it membership into the core of the podcast marketing circuit for celebrities, according to some listeners.</p>
<p>The podcast excels because of a possibly negative trait: There is never only one theme to an argument or episode. Shepard jumps from event to event within his guests' lives, honing in on their formative experiences and instilling a sense of whimsy rather than a lack of focus through an insatiable curiosity.</p>
<p>The podcast maintains its at-home roots, openness, and fascination with both the mundane and the perverse despite including obvious self-promotion.</p>
<p>In one episode, Dax and his co-host Monica Padman discuss their self-identification as "uniphiles" or people who are interested in fancy, higher education schools, such as Ivy Leagues. In another, they consider investing in a hotel targeting voyeurs and exhibitionists.</p>
<p>This episode features Lori Gottlieb, a psychotherapist, best-selling author, and journalist for both The Atlantic (Dear Therapist Column) and the New York Times.</p>
<p>"Change is really hard because change involves loss. Even really positive change involves loss because you lose the familiar." - Gottlieb</p>
<p>The necessary introduction to Gottlieb and her story is not the usual slog—Gottlieb commands the listener's attention toward her experiences with her talent for storytelling.</p>
<p>She started with a stint in the entertainment business, had an incomplete run at medical school, and then continued on to become a journalist before transitioning to a career in therapy.</p>
<p>Though the requisite mentions of Gottlieb's book Maybe You Should Talk to Someone reveal a private purpose of promotion, Shepard and Gottlieb disclose in ways that cannot be taken as anything other than sincere.</p>
<p>In these moments, it is impossible to tell if Gottlieb is selling her therapy, her book, or just her own lived experience.</p>
<p>Gottlieb's lighter observations on her professional practice reveal an unfamiliar side of therapy and provide balance to the heavier moments of her book, such as when a patient sexually harassed her.</p>
<p>Do patients ever tell their therapists "I love you"? Of course. Where do therapists turn when they need help? Therapy. How do therapists affirm they’re doing the right thing? Consultation groups of other therapists.</p>
<p>One failing though is that Gottlieb and, by extension, Shepard force psychological terms into the conversation, attempting to create aphorisms that aim to be simultaneously deep and digestible—an impossible duality.</p>
<p>For example, she refers to the concept of repetition compulsion with the phrase "We marry our unfinished business", which I took to mean that we enter subsequent relationships to complete and resolve problems in our previous ones, which seems to be a fatalistic perspective in opposition to Gottlieb’s own beliefs.</p>
<p>But again, her tell-all about the private world of therapy makes up for this shortcoming.</p>
<p>Like David Ogilvy, a door-to-door salesman who spun tales about Australian Aborigines and Nobel Prizes instead of professing product features, Gottlieb commits to the art of the sale through storytelling.</p>
<p>If you're looking to hear the quick and clean pros and cons on therapy, look elsewhere. But if you want learn how to better tell your own story, listen in, because Lori Gottlieb is about to sell you her own, and it's a damn good one.</p>
