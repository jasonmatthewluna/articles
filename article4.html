		<p class ="artsub">Disney's attempt at a cultural retrofit and live adaptation for the well-loved animation fails to reflect feminist values and traditional Chinese culture for audiences.</p>
		<p>The studio endeavoured to make a film more accurate to <em>The Ballad of Mulan</em> and more culturally relevant to a diverse audience.</p>
    <p>Of course, this makes sense: Some depictions from the original film were problematic (e.g. of the Huns), and Disney may have been worried about extratextual readings of their characters.</p>
    <p>However, early decisions, such as the removal of Mushu due to negative reception from Chinese audiences in 1999, demonstrated evidence of other influences shaping the film's narrative.</p>
    <p>Though Mushu was replaced with the symbol of the Phoenix, a common positive symbol in Chinese culture, the film misinterpreted the Phoenix as a symbol of rebirth, which is a western reading of the mythological creature.</p>
    <p>Additionally, early reports on <em>Mulan's</em> script featuring a White love interest and a European army incited fury from fans overthe possible removal of an iconic Asian love interest, Li Shang, from the story and rewrite the Mulan as part of the American canon.</p>
    <p>Though luckily, after some controversy, Disney reversed their decision, the studio still removed the character and shifted his role of general and love interest onto two separate characters.</p>
    <p>Many believe the source of these cultural inaccuracies and misteps is the lack of diversity on the production team, specifically with the directors, costume designers, and screenwriters.</p>
    <p>But the film's interpretation of feminism is likely its largest failing.</p>
    <p>Rather than have Mulan prove her mettle by training on equal grounds with her male soldier counterparts, she is naturally gifted with chi.</p>
    <p>While chi does give the film the flexibility to shoot wonderfully directed action scenes, evidently inspired by kung fu and Hong Kong action movies, set against breathtaking views of nature, it also makes Mulan the one thing she should not be: Special.</p>
    <p>There should be no gift or magical power behind Mulan's rise in the military.</p>
    <p>As in the original, it should be her own interpretation of her gender, her dedication to training, and her wit that carries her through to saving her nation.</p>
    <p>Instead of telling an inspiring message to young women, Mulan asks of them to look for what skills they have naturally been gifted.</p>
    <p>The concept of chi is not fully explored either. Though we are told Mulan is born with strong chi and must hide it, we do not understand who has chi (other than one of the film's antagonists) and how chi can be used.</p>
    <p>This key plot hole, which the story continues to call upon whenever Mulan needs to demonstrate some heroicism, removes the message of female empowerment the film purports to have.</p>
    <p>So, on two grounds of representation, the film has distorted its purpose.</p>
    <p>Even further, for older fans looking to relive a beloved story, the film again offers no respite. The removal of vocals from the soundtrack and of classic characters means no nostalgia over a drag race to save the emperor or over Mulan sorrowfully singing reflection.</p>
    <p>As a result, the film fails to appeal to all three groups in its core audience and feels like nothing more than a $30 a person cash grab by the giant as an experiment as to how far they can push exclusive content on their already subscription-based streaming model.</p>
    <p>Whether you find <em>Mulan</em> objectively successful likely depends on if you're viewing it from a financial perspective or a cultural one.</p>
    <p>The film likely did not surpass its over 200 million dollar budget, having made $60,000 in box offices overall and 35.5 million dollars from Disney+ subscribers. However, it did outperform other live action adaptations and provided a huge increase in subscriptions to the streaming platform.</p>
    <p>But, how might an adaptation more faithful to the 1999 animation have performed in the box offices and on Disney+?</p>
    <p>We'll never know.</p>
