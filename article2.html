		<p class ="artsub">The 12-member South Korean girl group is set to make a comeback October 19th with their third mini album titled "12:00". But after a 7-month hiatus and a lawsuit against their management company Blockberry Creative resulting in a 360 million won loss, fans might be asking "So What?".</p>
		<p>The Seoul Central District Court ordered Polaris Entertainment, Blockberry Creative's parent label, to pay the sum to Donut, a tech company behind the streaming app "My Live."</p>
		<p><Donut had formalized a contract with Polaris Entertainment to have LOONA promote this app through livestreamed video events, though only one LOONA member attended any event from the company.</p>
		<p>Because LOONA filmed multiple videos for their own channel on a similar but more popular platform, V-Live, throughout the contract period, many Orbits (the name for LOONA's fans) criticized LOONA's company for their inability to fulfill their promotional duties.</p>
		<p>This is not the first time a large investment in the girl group has not paid off: The group is the product of a million dollar investment by Polaris and other investors in a two year pre-debut project of solo and subunit releases that preceded the full group's debut.</p>
		<p>From October 2017 to May 2018, each member had their own solo debut and eleven of the twelve members gained experience recording and promoting in the group's three subunits.</p>
		<p>The group had released 50 songs even before LOONA's debut August 2018.</p>
		<p>But the project was expensive: Many of the 50 songs included music videos, and each member filmed their music video in a new location. HeeJin filmed in Paris, HaSeul in Iceland, Hyunjin in Japan, and the list goes on.</p>
		<p>LOONA's Creative Director at the time chose these locations both for their beauty and relevance to the lore he built for LOONA: LOONA's story was multi-dimensional and brought together girls from across the world. Orbits affectionately dubbed it the LOONAverse and drew parallels with the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
		<p>The group's travels were often filmed as part of LOONA's own variety show, LOONA TV, released on their own YouTube channel.</p>
		<p>These short episodes reveal that Blockberry Creative often brought members who were not part of that particular album's promotions on these international trips, adding to the sum of the cost for this ambitious project.</p>
		<p>However, few Korean fans seemed to take notice.</p>
		<p>But in some ways, the investment did land the group fan attention. Fans across the globe started to trend the phrase "Stan LOONA" on every corner of the internet, even those outside of the traditional K-Pop sphere.</p>
		<p>This international fan support, contrasted with what little attention the group was receiving in Korea at the time, along with the seemingly no-name company investing so much in an unknown group of girls and outputting a seemingly endless stream of content with English subtitles brought comparisons to now international superstars BTS and their company BigHit Entertainment.</p>
		<p>The viral yet irritating "Stan LOONA" trend might remind some of the time when every YouTube video's top comment was "Any Army here? XD"</p>
		<p>In fact, LOONA even received positive attention for their cover of BTS' Fire.</p>
		<p>But after LOONA's debut with ++ and title track Hi High and return with repackaged album xx with Butterfly, the flow of content stopped.</p>
		<p>It would be another full year before fans would hear another release from the group named "Girl of the Month" for their once almost monthly content.</p>
		<p>Because of this shift in release schedule from feast to famine, LOONA might draw comparisons with another group with an October comeback date: Blackpink.</p>
		<p>That is not to say that famine might not be part of Blockberry Creative's strategy.</p>
		<p>Largely, Blackpink's releases have been hotly anticipated and awarded. Though the group has a fairly small discography (fewer than 20 songs), each instantly receives millions of views and has landed Blackpink performances at Coachella and collaborations with Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, and more.</p>
		<p>Orbits even have a habit of making famine a somewhat profitable or productive period for LOONA.</p>
		<p>In response to the judgement from the aforementioned lawsuit, fan support brought LOONA's debut mini album ++ soaring to #1 on the US iTunes chart. Many of LOONA's works have also received similar boosts from Orbits looking to show support in times of misfortune for the group.</p>
		<p>After the year-long hiatus, LOONA even began to see heightened attention from the Korean public and interest from other Korean companies. Notably, Lee Soo Man, founder of SM Entertainment, assisted in the production of their February comeback title track "So What?", which netted them their first win on the Korean music show circuit, and he has continued to lend a hand in production for "12:00".</p>
		<p>But over a period of 3 ears of activity and a vast catalogue of songs, fans might be wondering why Blockberry Creative isn't taking more advantage of LOONA's moment in the spotlight after promising and failing to deliver on multiple releases.</p>
		<p>Of course, the group has had its fair share of misfortunes, from a change in distributor leading to album shortages and release delays, a family death for the leader of the group (leading to her two year hiatus), and the alleged deletion of at least three of the group's songs for project group La Maison LOONA (LOONA the Ballad) after the firing of ex-Creative Director Jaden Jeong due to disagreement over the importance of LOONA's lore to future releases, but this doesn't excuse a lack of music or promotions for fans.</p>
		<p>Is the company waiting on HaSeul to return because she might play an important part to the group's story? Have they lost their train of thought on how to continue the lore? Are they running low on funding for LOONA?</p>
		<p>If the project doesn't show some pay off soon, who knows how long fans will be willing to wait for their return on investment?</p>
