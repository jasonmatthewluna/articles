		<h1 class = "arthead"><em>Do You Like Brahms?</em> is a Step in the Right Direction for Korean Dramas</h1>
		<p class ="artsub">For once, the camera doesn't follow our lead actress' every move.</p>
		<p><em>Do You Like Brahms?</em> follows non-traditional violin student Chae Song-Ah (Park Eun-Bin) as she navigates her status as last chair of her year and her friendships with top students such as love interest professional pianist Park Joon-Young (Kim Minjae).</p>
		<p>Of course, it's still a melodrama in classic Korean drama fashion, from its frustrating love polygon (a hexagon in this case) and condescending upper class cast. One might even venture to say it's a retelling of <em>When the Weather is Fine</em>, another melodrama from winter this year that also takes a tepid and slow approach to romance.</p>
		<p>However, <em>Do You Like Brahms?</em> improves upon <em>When the Weather is Fine</em>'s biggest mistake: It lets its characters breathe and have life outside of the story on camera.</p>
		<p>Unlike many romance serials, <em>Do You Like Brahms?</em> isn't afraid to pull back the camera, take out the audio, and play a sappy ballad while Song-Ah and Joon-Young talk.</p>
		<p>This seemingly minor change comes with great weight. Often, dramas drown viewers with every small development in a relationship and affectionate comment.</p>
		<p>Though many fans of the medium adore this cheesy, yet heart-melting dialogue, the imagined conversation evokes a sense of there being more intimacy in the main couple's relationship.</p>
		<p>We might not be able to watch Song-Ah through each stage of her growing crush on Joon-Young and vice-versa, but we don't have to. We have a tacit understanding that they've been there for one another in hard times and that they've spoken on more occasions than those that might fit within the frame of 16 episodes of airtime.</p>
		<p>The genre also often features more demure or reserved characters, a description Song-Ah definitely fits under. However, we see huge progress for Song-Ah from her prior crush to this one on Joon-Young.</p>
		<p>It's an improvement and also rare event for female leads when she confesses her love to Joon-Young despite her own apprehensions. This bravery is made even more special when she takes back her promise that she'll wait for him, telling him that there's more to her life and what she loves than just him.</p>
		<p>It might not be the strong proclamation of independence we might want from a character facing someone who has oscillated between hot and cold but it's a realistic portrayal of someone dealing with their own real feelings.</p>
